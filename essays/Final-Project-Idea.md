## A Simple Web App for Easy Meetups
<br><br>

## Overview:

Problem:

Organizing meetups for work, study, or fun can be difficult due to many communication channels and the lack of a central system in the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

Solution:

We propose a web app to help people arrange meetups easily by categorizing them by purpose and providing a user-friendly interface.




## Mockup page ideas

Home Page: The main page of the website displays various card components using react-bootstrap representing different meetups. Users can scroll through and click on cards for more information, including comments from participants.

Filter and Tags: Users can easily filter meetups card by tags (e.g., location, topic, group size) to find events that match their interests and preferences.

Countdown Timer: Each card component features a countdown timer, indicating the time left before the appointment, encouraging users to join events in a timely manner.

Communication Tools: The application provides built-in email and text messaging features, allowing users to send invitations, reminders, and updates to attendees directly from the platform.

Registration and Interests: Users can create a personalized profile, selecting their interests and preferences to receive recommendations for relevant meetups.


## Use Case Ideas:

Friends planning a lunch outing can create a fun (lunch) meetup, set a date and time, and invite others. Attendees can discuss details in the comments section.

A work team needing a meeting can create a work meetup, invite members, and use the platform to send reminders.

A study group looking for new members can create a study meetup, tag it with relevant subjects, and let interested users find and join.



## Beyond the Basics:

With the app's success, we can explore additional features like:

In-app messaging for real-time communication between attendees.
Integration with popular calendar apps for easy scheduling.
Smart recommendations based on users' past meetups and interests.
A mobile app version for on-the-go access and event reminders.
