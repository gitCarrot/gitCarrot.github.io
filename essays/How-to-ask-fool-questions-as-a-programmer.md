## The way you make a bad question   
StackOverFlow encounters people who ask questions in various ways and perspectives. There are questions that are very insincere to anyone, or have paid a lot of attention to detail, but not many articles that can accurately grasp the intention of the questioner and answer it close to it. Sometimes, wrong answers from respondents who misinterpret the intention of the problem, or solutions that do not fit the version, make the questioner more embarrassed. The ability to ask questions well to stack overflow will create smooth and reliable communication with developers and project progress even in the job.
What Eric Raymond provided in his guidelines for effective interaction with the open source community [(How to ask questions the smart way)](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) are the way you can upgrade the question as a developer with some tips to help respondents understand questions well. If you follow the conditions on how to ask smart questions from his article, you will know how to ask bad questions to disrupt developers' communication and not get the right answer to the questions.   <br/>


## Bad response from a Fool Question   
(The insincere questions that were not written properly were skipped)

[Fool Question on StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19860470/spring-error-org-springframework-beans-factory-beancreationexception)

Some might think that this questioner posted several error code messages describing symptoms of the problem well, and the details about the project code and settings.
The big drawback of this question is to just post the code with the error message and say I can't find the error. Many frameworks and libraries often have different dependencies, usage, and functions depending on the version. However, there was no talk about the spring version and settings in words, and it made the respondents have to find the code themselves to see the properties of the spring and see what the problem is. The detailed code would make it easier for developers to catch errors, however you can't find what projects, what functions the questioner was working on before getting errors. What efforts he made through Google to resolve the error does not exist. At last, "Any suggestions? Thanks!" This statement shows that he didn't describe and summarize the problem's symptoms well and the question is not specific at all.   <br/>

## Smart makes clear response

[Smart Question on StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28902374/spring-boot-rest-service-exception-handling)

The author of this question has all three things: "Specify the problem," "Notify the setting and progress of the current project," and "The efforts he has made to resolve the error."
Before elaborating on the problem, Heather has a good summary of the problem and information about the well-organized project. In the body, he wrote down the spring functions that he wants to implement and supportive stacks in this project by solving the error. Even though the author did not post the code, he described exactly what the error was, specified the background he knew and the relationship with it, and asked respondents in advance how they could give solutions without using Node.js chains, which led them to write more accurate answers that the questioner wanted. Looking at the response in this question, there are much longer and more kindly accurate articles than questions.
