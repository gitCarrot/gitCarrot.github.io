This semester in my Software Engineering class, I embarked on an enriching journey of learning and collaboration. Our primary task involved migrating an existing Meteor project, which originally utilized libraries like Semantic UI and Lodash, to a modernized version incorporating Bootstrap and more recent, efficient libraries. This essay encapsulates my experiences, challenges, and the invaluable lessons I learned during this course.

The essence of our project was to enhance the user interface of all pages, making them more user-friendly and visually appealing. Our team, comprising seven members including myself, was tasked with achieving seven milestones throughout the project. Professor Moore played a crucial role, providing feedback after each milestone, guiding us on areas requiring improvement.

## Team Dynamics and Challenges

<br>
One of the significant challenges we faced was effective collaboration. The progression of our project heavily depended on the leadership provided during team meetings. There were instances where the lack of proactive leadership hampered our development process. Additionally, my personal contribution was occasionally hindered by errors encountered during library migration and code refactoring.

## Learning and Development

A notable learning experience for me was the creation of a button for database dumping. This feature was designed to remove specific or all collections, including slugs. Implementing this required a deep understanding of the pre-existing Meteor API, along with the intricate relationships and flows between various API files. This task underscored the importance of comprehensive knowledge in software development.

## Code Review and Progress

Our weekly meetings on Mondays were dedicated to code reviews. We meticulously examined specific files that needed migration and modification. These sessions proved invaluable for those tasked with refining the reviewed pages, providing clear guidelines on necessary fixes and UI design changes.

## Balancing Academics and Project Work

Juggling this project with other academic responsibilities was a challenging yet rewarding experience. Although the pace of our progress was sometimes slower than desired due to academic pressures, it was gratifying to see our team meet each milestone. This aspect of the project highlighted the importance of time management and prioritization in a real-world software development environment.

## Conclusion
<br><br>
In conclusion, this Software Engineering class has been a journey of growth, teamwork, and practical learning. The challenges faced and the skills acquired are integral to my development as a software engineer. This experience has not only improved my technical abilities but also enriched my understanding of effective teamwork and project management in the field of software development.
